# Notebooks

This repository contains R and Python code that is used in the BSc programme Soil, Water, Atmosphere and the MSc programme Earth and Environment of Wageningen University, The Netherlands. 

Some code is presented in interactive tutorials for programming in R and Python. [Here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/soil-water-atmosphere/notebooks/master) you can open the notebooks in the Jupyter environment. This also permits the opening of an RStudio session in the browser through the *New* button on the right of the screen. 

The notebooks and scripts are organised per course or field. Please note that this repository is still quite new, so we are still busy to fill it.
