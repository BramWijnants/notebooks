R scripts for hydrological data analysis
==

This folder contains some scripts that can be useful for data analysis. These are plain R scripts (not interactive Jupyter notebooks) that you can download and open in R. You can download the data necessary to run the scripts from the *data* subfolder. In the *figures* and *output* subfolders you can see what the scripts create (and try to reproduce that yourself). 

The scripts are made for hydrological analyses, but most of them can be applied just as easily to examples from other fields. You can use them in courses, for theses (BSc, MSc and PhD) or any other programming project.

If you don't know how to build scripts yet, do self study modules 4-8 on the GitHub site of
[A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/tree/master/Self%20study%20modules).

Note that this repository is dynamic: we just started it, so it's still quite empty, but we will keep adding scripts.
